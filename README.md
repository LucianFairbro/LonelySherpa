PRIVACY POLICY
Effective Date: 3/21/2025
Welcome to Loney Sherpa (“the App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, store, and protect your personal information. By using the App, you agree to the terms described here.

1. SCOPE & APPLICABILITY
The App is intended for individuals 12 years of age or older.
This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through the App, including any mobile or web-based version.
By using the App, you acknowledge that we rely on Firebase for data storage and security, and do not maintain our own secure servers.

2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We collect the following categories of information to enable core features and maintain the App:
Contact Information


Name: Used to personalize your profile.
Email Address: Used for account authentication, password resets, and notifications.
Other Contact Info: If provided (e.g., phone number or social media handle), used for display in your profile or facilitating user interactions.
Health & Sensitive Data


Health Information: If you choose to share details about medical conditions or treatments, it is stored to facilitate health updates or personal tracking.
Sensitive Information: If you voluntarily share information about race, religion, orientation, etc., it is treated the same as health data, only used within the App’s functionality.
User Content


Photos or Videos: Any media uploads are stored so they can be displayed in posts or within your profile.
Other User Content: Posts, messages, or comments you submit to the App are stored to facilitate interactions and social features.
Diagnostic & Usage Data


Crash Data: Logs and device details help diagnose and fix issues.
Performance Data: Metrics like load times assist in optimizing the App’s functionality.
Other Diagnostic Data: Additional technical data may be collected to troubleshoot errors and improve stability.

3. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION
Directly From You: When you create an account, post content, or otherwise interact with App features.
Automatically: Through Firebase’s crash reporting, performance monitoring, or similar services for stability.
Third-Party Services (Firebase): Firebase manages your data’s storage and security. We do not operate our own secure servers—your data is stored on Firebase’s infrastructure.

4. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
Core Functionality: We use your data to enable user authentication, create or display profiles, and support in-App posting or commenting.
Communications: We may use your email or other contact info for account-related notices (e.g., password resets, important updates).
Diagnostics & Improvements: Crash logs, performance data, and other diagnostic info help us fix bugs and refine the App.
Personalization: Your data (e.g., name, photos) is displayed as part of your profile or content in the App.
We do not sell or lease your personal data for advertising or marketing purposes.

5. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
12+ Intended Use: The App is designed for users 12 years and older. We do not knowingly allow those under 12 to create accounts.
Users Under 13: If we learn that a child under 13 has provided personal data, we will delete that information promptly.
Parental Involvement: If you believe your child (under 13) has used the App, please contact us to remove their data.

6. DATA SHARING & DISCLOSURE
Firebase (Service Provider):
We rely on Firebase (provided by Google) for user authentication, storage, and analytics.
Firebase may collect device information and usage data per their own policies, but they process it only to help us run the App.
Legal Obligations: We may disclose data if required by law or legal process (e.g., subpoenas, court orders).
Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, user data may be transferred under appropriate confidentiality agreements.

7. DATA SECURITY
Firebase-Managed Security: We rely on Firebase’s infrastructure, which includes encryption in transit and at rest for stored data. We do not operate our own secure servers.
No Absolute Guarantees: While Firebase implements robust measures, no system is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee complete data security.
Your Responsibility: Exercise caution when sharing personal details and keep your account credentials confidential.

8. DATA RETENTION
We retain your personal information as long as your account is active or as necessary for the App’s core functionality.
If you wish to delete your account or personal data, please contact us (see Contact Us). We will remove your information unless we are legally required to retain certain records.

9. YOUR RIGHTS & CHOICES
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
Access or correct your personal data.
Request deletion or restriction of processing.
Object to certain processing activities or withdraw consent, where applicable.
To exercise these rights, contact us at lucian@evogut.com. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

10. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with a new Effective Date. If the changes are significant, we may also notify you via in-App messaging or email. Your continued use of the App after any changes signifies your acceptance of the revised Policy.
